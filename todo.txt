get_all_frames_profile convert cell->3d array so no conversion needed for clustering

Problems:

1.kmeans ignoring rows with NaN data and #clusters must be greater than points condition is not satisfies because each point is having NaN alteast once.
Solution:NaN can be reduced by decreasing value of d, NaN coming in skewness and krutosis property when variance is 0.
observation:d=3,frames=50,=>9frames contains NaN,which is present in depth property only, not in brightness.

2.get_all_frames_profile function is very slow try to speed up if possible.
