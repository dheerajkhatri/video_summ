get_all_frames_profile convert cell->3d array so no conversion needed for clustering

Problems:
1.kmeans ignoring rows with NaN data and #clusters must be greater than points condition is not satisfies because each point is having NaN alteast once.
2.get_all_frames_profile function is very slow try to speed up if possible.
